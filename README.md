# Portfolio
In my portfolio you can read about me in a slideshow and can see the projects I worked on.
First, you see an image snapshot of a working web site of a project. When you move the coursor over an image, it will scale up a bit and some information will be shown with a link to go to a working web side hosted on github.
In the footer, you can find several links pointing to my linkedIn profile, github location and my stackoverflow profile.

Please enjoy it.

# Technology used
I have used several technoligies while working on this project: HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, (I added some animation as well).
